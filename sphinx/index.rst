News
===========

Release 1.0.0 (February 05. 2022)
---------------------------------

Sty v1.0.0 released ðŸŽ‰

At this point sty can be considered stable.

The "release candidate" phase was given a lot of time and nothing critical was reported for a while.
All features that are planned for the future are compatible with the existing interfaces.

Nothing changed since `rc.2`.


Release 1.0.0-rc.2 (August 28. 2021)
-------------------------------------

* Fix typo in "reset" register.

`Release Note (Breaking Changes) <https://github.com/feluxe/sty/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc.2>`__



Release 1.0.0-rc.1 (January 31. 2021)
-------------------------------------

* Sty is now fully typed.
* Deprecated methods `.set_style(...)` and `.get_style(...)` were finally removed.

`Release Note <https://github.com/feluxe/sty/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc.1>`__



Release 1.0.0-rc.0 (January 08. 2021)
-------------------------------------

Sty version `1.0.0` is now feature complete.

* I'm going to support Python version `>=3.7` indefinitely.
* Sty will follow `semver` so there won't be any breaking changes for version `1.x.x` after 1.0.0 was released.
* This is a pre-release (`rc.0`). I'll release `1.0.0` in a couple of month if no major bugs are reported.

`Breaking Changes <https://github.com/feluxe/sty/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc.0>`__


Description
===========

------------

Sty's goal is to provide Python with a simple, customizable and performant string styling markup, which
is decoupled from color palettes and terminal implementations.

* Sty supports 3/4bit, 8bit and 24bit (truecolor/RGB) colors as well as effects like `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, etc.
* Sty should work on most Unix platforms with most terminals. It works with recent Windows terminals. Window legacy terminal (cmd) needs a `shim <https://github.com/feluxe/sty/issues/2#issuecomment-501890699>`__ to work.
* Sty comes with default color palettes and renderers, but you can easily replace/customize them, without touching the markup in your code.
* Sty allows you to mute/unmute all styles in your codebase.
* Sty provides high access performance for all styling rules.
* Sty is fully typed, you should get good editor support for it.
* Sty does not implicitly mess with globals. E.g.: `colorama` overrides `sys.stdout` which causes a lot of trouble.
* Sty has no dependencies.
* Sty follows `semver <https://semver.org/>`__
* Sty will support Python `>=3.7` for as long as possible.

If you run into compatibility problems with sty, please file an `issue <https://github.com/feluxe/sty/issues>`__!
